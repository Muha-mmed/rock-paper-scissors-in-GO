# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game written in Go. The player competes against the computer, and each game outcome is displayed along with a running score.

## How It Works

1. The game presents three options: "rock," "paper," and "scissors."
2. The player inputs their choice.
3. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
4. The winner is determined by traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beat Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
5. The score is updated after each round, and the game continues until manually stopped.

## Features

- Keeps track of the player's and computer's scores.
- Displays the result of each round (win, lose, or tie).
- Simple command-line interface.
